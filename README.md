## Player Classes

There are a number of planned player classes, each with their own flavor and
set of abilities.

### Mage

As a mage, Twitch posseses amazing magical abilities.

1. Faire Fire: Twitch casts a goute of magical fire to trundle across the world.
2. Concentration: Twitch pauses to consider the ebb and flow of the arcane, empowering his next Faire Fire cast.
3. Teleport: Twitch blinks through time and space a few feet ahead of his current position.

### Rogue

1. Dagger strike: Twitch lashes out with a toxined blade. Deals double damage if he's undetected.
2. Swift Stride: Twitch scurries across the world, increasing his movement speed as well as his detectability.
